  "Creates a mocked Datomic connection from the given *starting-point* database, or an empty database if none provided.

Implicitly backed by Datomic's speculative writes (#'datomic.api/with).
The returned connection is local and has no URI access.

Exceptions thrown during writes will be systematically wrapped in an j.u.c.ExecutionExecption
to emulate the behaviour of a remote transactor.

The #db(), #transact(), #transactAsync(), #txReportQueue(), #removeTxReportQueue() and #log() methods are fully supported.
Housekeeping methods (#requestIndex(), #release(), #gcStorage()) are implemented as noops.
Sync methods have a trivial implementation.

The starting-point database will be the current database at the time of forking.

Note that if #log() is not supported by `conn` (as is the case for mem connections prior to Datomic 0.9.5407),
the forked connection will support #log(), but the returned Log will only contain transactions committed after forking.

See documentation of #'mock-conn for the characteristics of the returned Connection."
